## How to run the project: 

We have configured the project for quick execution. Please execute the "Drive.py" file, and configure the desired operation (including train, val, test) in the "tasks" directory. You can modify relevant parameters in the "tasks" directory, and these changes will take effect when running the code.



## Dataset: 

The dataset is quite large, and we have uploaded it to Google Drive. Please visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AXCellPWI68Qnm2_1pCHx_hVn5fsAS78/view?usp=sharing to download it.



Thank you.
